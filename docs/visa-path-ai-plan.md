## Why This Beats Common Hackathon Entries

❌ **Generic**: "AI chatbot for visa questions" — VisaVerse already exists (uses old tech)
✅ **VisaPath AI**: Predictive + generative + interactive + visual

❌ **Too broad**: "AI for global collaboration" — vague, hard to demo
✅ **VisaPath AI**: Laser-focused on visa process automation

❌ **No MVP**: "Concept for visa blockchain insurance" — not buildable in 9 days
✅ **VisaPath AI**: Fully functional, deployed, demo-able
